# KnowledgeBaseUPV

This project aims to improve how students use AI to prepare for exams. With
accessible large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini,
students often need to spend a significant amount of time attaching course
materials. This can be especially difficult when a subject includes many PDF
files.

## Step by step

1. First create .venv
2. Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to have all the dependencies
3. run `python main.py`

## Rules

The following rules help keep the project organized:

1. Write everything in English, including commits and comments.
2. To add a new model, create a new `.py` file inside the provider's folder.
3. Before improving an existing file, add an entry to the improvement log at
   the top of the file. Use this template:

   ```python
   """Log:
   - YYYY-MM-DD - [NAME]: Describe the improvement made in this file.
   """
   ```

   Add a new dated entry without removing previous entries. Commits that do
   not follow this convention may be rejected.
